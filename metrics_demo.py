But components are a better way to go.

Hi @saxon11,

Just to clarify: The Streamlit documentation is not a Streamlit app. We use Next.js, React, and Markdown to build the site and Netlify to host it. The code is public: GitHub - streamlit/docs: Source code for the Streamlit Python library documentation 242

Best, :balloon:

Hi @yeshwanth1312

I donâ€™t have the earlier code as that was written just for a temporary purpose.

I have re-written the following code only for 1 kpi metric. You can do:
a. put the code in a function, so you can all it many times
b. change the parameters & variables to suit your purpose
c. use st.columns for multiple kpi metrics, etc.

# variables
wch_colour_box = (0, 204, 102)  # green
wch_colour_font = (0, 0, 0)  # blackfont
fontsize = 18
valign = "left"
iconname = "fas fa-asterisk"
sline = "Users" # kpi name
lnk = ''
i = 1000  # kpi value
htmlstr = f"""

                         {i}
                        


                    <span style='font-size: 18px;
                    margin-top: 0;'>{sline}</style>
                    </span></p>"""

st.markdown(lnk + htmlstr, unsafe_allow_html=True)


Also, pasting a snapshot of the code here, as my copy-paste makes some of my text disappear.

Just try out the code given in the picture above, and then modify it for your use, as needed.

Hi @Shawn_Pereira ,

I tried the code you suggested but it doesnâ€™t work. Layout is not taken into account.
My code :

Hi @Oceane

I suggest that you:

properly duplicate my code
then check if it works for you
and thereafter modify it to suit your needs
At first glance, I see some errors in your code:

The lnk variable is missing
â€˜order-radiusâ€™ should be â€˜border-radiusâ€™
the last link (markdown) does not have the lnk variable as in my code
Lastly, you will have to work with the available streamlit layouts. Use columns, containers, etc. You would need to do a little experimenting.

Hereâ€™s the demo code, if you want to copy-paste:

import streamlit as st

wch_colour_box = (0,204,102)
wch_colour_font = (0,0,0)
fontsize = 18
valign = "left"
iconname = "fas fa-asterisk"
sline = "Observations"
lnk = '<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://use.fontawesome.com/releases/v5.12.1/css/all.css" crossorigin="anonymous">'
i = 123

htmlstr = f"""<p style='background-color: rgb({wch_colour_box[0]}, 
                                              {wch_colour_box[1]}, 
                                              {wch_colour_box[2]}, 0.75); 
                        color: rgb({wch_colour_font[0]}, 
                                   {wch_colour_font[1]}, 
                                   {wch_colour_font[2]}, 0.75); 
                        font-size: {fontsize}px; 
                        border-radius: 7px; 
                        padding-left: 12px; 
                        padding-top: 18px; 
                        padding-bottom: 18px; 
                        line-height:25px;'>
                        <i class='{iconname} fa-xs'></i> {i}
                        </style><BR><span style='font-size: 14px; 
                        margin-top: 0;'>{sline}</style></span></p>"""

st.markdown(lnk + htmlstr, unsafe_allow_html=True)
Cheers
